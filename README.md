## FAQ

### 1. Why did you use streamlit?

Answer :  Streamlit is extremely useful for rapid development and prototyping. Since the core focus of this project was on showcasing the concept (OCR + LLM-powered automation) rather than frontend complexity, Streamlit allowed me to quickly build an interactive UI with minimal effort.

### 2. Why SQlite , why not others like Postgre or MySql?

Answer : I chose SQLite because I plan to eventually extend this project to mobile platforms. SQLite is lightweight, file-based, and serverless, making it ideal for embedding into apps without the need for external database servers. This helps keep the entire system self-contained and easy to deploy anywhere.

### 3. Do I need internet for LLM parsing?
Answer : Yes, if you're using Groq or OpenRouter for LLM parsing. For full offline functionality, replace it with a local model.

### 4. What kinds of bills does this support?
Answer: SmartBill Manager works best with scanned or clear images of printed invoices, especially those with standard structure (vendor name, amount, due date, etc.).

### 5. Is this production-ready?
Itâ€™s a proof-of-concept. For production, add authentication, PDF export, error logging, and better OCR tuning.
